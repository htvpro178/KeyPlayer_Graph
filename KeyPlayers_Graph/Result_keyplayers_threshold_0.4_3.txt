The list of 3 the vertexes have the influence as maximum in the network: 
The number of affected from vertex 2(D) passed the threshold 0.4 : 3
This vertex affects to other vertexes that passed the threshold: 
3 4 3 4 7 
The influence to every vertexes:
3 : 0.8
4 : 0.8
3 : 0.75
4 : 0.803571
7 : 0.5

The number of affected from vertex 6(C) passed the threshold 0.4 : 2
This vertex affects to other vertexes that passed the threshold: 
4 3 4 
The influence to every vertexes:
4 : 1
3 : 0.8
4 : 0.8

The number of affected from vertex 5(A) passed the threshold 0.4 : 1
This vertex affects to other vertexes that passed the threshold: 
4 4 
The influence to every vertexes:
4 : 0.428571
4 : 0.6
