Installation
============

To install SocNetV 1.x you need Qt5 development libraries.
Qt is an open source C++ toolkit published under the GPL.
Most modern Linux distros, especially those providing KDE as their default
desktop environment, include Qt. The Qt5 toolkit is also available for Windows,
Mac and mobile devices.

If you have Qt5 installed, all you have to do is to type in the following
commands in order to decompress the SocNetV tarball and build it.
Replace 1.X with the version you downloaded...

1) untar zxfv SocNetV-1.X.tar.gz 

2) cd socnetv-1.X

3) qmake

4) make

5) sudo make install

Probably you have already done the first 2 steps, so just type in 'qmake' or 'qmake-qt5'.
If Qt5 is not installed, the script will let you know...

When you finish compiling and installing, run the application typing: 

socnetv

or go to Start Menu > Mathematics  > SocNetV.
