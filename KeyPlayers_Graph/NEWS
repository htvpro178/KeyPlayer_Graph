Dec 2015
=========
- Version 2.0 development starts.
- New doxygen source documentation 
- New Windows Installer
- Improved Force-Directed layouts, i.e. Fructherman-Reingold, Eades

June 2015
=========
- Version 1.9 released with lots of bugfixes and a faster matrix inverse routine using LU decomposition. 
  Also Information Centrality is greatly improved in terms of computation speed.
  PageRank Prestige algorithm corrected to compute PR using the correct formula. The initial PR score 
  of each node is now 1/N.
  Bugs closed:
  #1463069 wrong average distance when there are isolates 
  #1365037 certain sparse matrices crash socnetv on invertMatrix method 
  #1365582 centralityInformation() is slow when network N>100 
  #1463095 edge filter works but the user cannot undo 
  #1464422 wrong pagerank results 
  #1464430 socnetv refuses to read pajek files not starting with *Network 
  #1465774 edges do not always follow relations 
  #1463082 edge color change is not taking place 
  #1464418 socnetv crashes on pagerank computation on isolated nodes 

- Version 1.8 released with the following new features: 
  New clique census routine to compute maximal cliques with up to 4 vertices.
  New Scale-free random generation methods. Improved Erdos-Renyi generation to include G(n,M) model. 
  Fixed bug in Clustering Coefficient - SocNetV now computes CluCof correctly in all cases.
  New improved dialogs for easy random network generation (Scale-free, Erdos-Renyi, and Small-World)
  Fixed bug in Node Properties dialog. It is now populated with current node settings.

May 2015
========
- Version 1.7 released. New node group select/edit functionality and file previewer supporting  different codecs
- Version 1.6 released. New and improved web crawler functionality. See Changelog for more.

Oct 2014
========
- Version 1.5 released. First version with dijkstra algorithm for the SSSP in weighted nets. See Changelog for more.

Sep 2014
========
- Version 1.4 released. Brought new layout type (nodal size by prominence index), edgelist1 UCINET format import method and many bugfixes.

Aug 2014
========
- Version 1.3 released.
- First time SocNetV works with multigraphs 

Aug 2014
=======
- Version 1.2 released. It features a major GUI overhaul and brings in a new "prominence indices" conceptualization based on Wasserman & Faust. 
  In general, Centrality indices focus on outLinks (choices given) while Prestige indices consider inLinks (choices received).
  Added 3 Prestige indices (Degree, Proximity and PageRank), new reachability measures (Walks, Connectedness, and Reachability Matrix) and fixed a slew of bugs in indices calculation. 
  All algorithms are now tested to report 100% correct results.
- Version 1.1 released with major bug fixes. See ChangeLog.
- First time distribution of a disk image for installation in Mac OS X
