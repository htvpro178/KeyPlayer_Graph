\section Knownbugs Known Bugs

All known bugs are documented in the project's [bug tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/socnetv). 

SocNetV started as a hobby project but we keep improving it. From version 1.9 we think that most bugs have been resolved.

Nevertheless, if you encounter a bug, please submit a bug report (see below).
