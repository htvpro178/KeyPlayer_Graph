Description: Social Networks Analysis and Visualization software
 SocNetV (Social Network Visualiser) is a flexible and
 user-friendly tool for Social Networks Analysis and Visualisation.
 It lets you create new networks (graphs) with a few clicks on a
 virtual canvas or load networks of various formats (GraphML, 
 GraphViz, Adjacency, UCINET, Pajek, etc) and modify them to suit 
 your needs.
 .
 The application can compute network properties, such as density,
 diameter and geodesic distances, as well as node-wise and network 
 indices such as various types of Centrality and Prestige. 
 Various layout algorithms (i.e. Spring-embedder, circular and in
 levels according to prominence indices) are supported for 
 meaningful visualisations of your networks. Furthermore, it can
 create various random networks (Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, 
 ring lattice, etc) with a few clicks.
