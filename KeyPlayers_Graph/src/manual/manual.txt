\tableofcontents

Social Network Visualizer (SocNetV) is a cross-platform, user-friendly application for the analysis and visualization of Social Networks in the form of mathematical graphs, where vertices depict actors/agents and edges represent their relations.

This is the manual of SocNetV which is divided in the following sections:
- \subpage intro "Introduction"
- \subpage gui "User Interface"
- \subpage generate "Network generator"
- \subpage formats "Supported Network Formats"
- \subpage analysis "Network Analysis Methods"
- \subpage visualisation "Layout Algorithms"
- \subpage bugs "Troubleshooting and bug reports"
- \subpage credits "Credits and Licenses"

If you are interested in the algorithms behind Social Network Visualizer, you can browse the [annotated version of the source code](annotated.html). And if you are a C++/Qt developer, you can help our project by commiting your patches (new features and bugfixes) to our [source code development tree](http://sourceforge.net/p/socnetv/git/ci/develop/tree/).
