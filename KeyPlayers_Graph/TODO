KNOWN BUGS
==========

1: Negative weights break centralities
2: UCINET (DL) files in nodelist1 format (one-mode) are not supported.  
3: isSymmetric() not 100% (check a-symmetry.net)
4: Some Graphviz (dot) files do not load. See test2.dot. Cant read when one line and nodes dont appear...
5: 2014-02-28: In Reciprocal links with diferrent weight, only the first weight is taken into account
6: closeness reports wrong indices in digraphs, where one actor has only one outLink
